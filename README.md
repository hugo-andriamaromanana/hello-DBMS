# hello-DBMS

## Some context

Hello-DBMS is a multi-purpose exercice that oversees fundamental concepts in data science. We will cover how to manupilate data with sql queries, as well as it's definition, how it is store and different ways to do it. 

## Some new questions

A. **What is Data? In what forms can it appear?**
   - **Definition**: Data, plural of datum, is information manifested as text, numbers, audio, images and more, which goal is to used to analyze something or make decision.
   - **Forms**: Data is represented in different ways, we have tables, graphs, different ways of storing such as through row collumns, vectors, arrays and much more.

B. **Criteria for Data Quality Measurement and Explanation**
   - **Criteria**: Depending on the domain dayta "quality" is defined by it's accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and reliability. And in some broad contexts such as medicine and sociology, "diversity" is more than a factor of quality but also a requirement. 

C. **Data Lake, Data Warehouse, and Lake House Definitions and Comparisons**
   - **Data Lake**: Mostly used by "Big Data" companies, it is the place where the data is stored in it's rawest form.
   - **Data Warehouse**: Usually the middle ground, it is the place where we store data in after it's been treated/analysed.
   - **Lake House**: A hybrid way of doing best of both world, usually productions are linked to these.

D. **Database Management Systems (DBMS) Definitions, Examples, and Illustrations**
   - **Definition**: DBMS is a database manager system, it is a interface that simplifies management and manipulation of a database
   - **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
    ##### ADD ILLUSTRATIONS

E. **Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases, Differences, and Examples**
   - **Relational Database**: Stores Data interlinked with one another, a good way to visual this is graphQL
   - **Non-Relational Database**: Stores data in a free environment, we say it is structureless, like MongoDB
   - **Differences**: The main differences are use cases, both are used for different purposes, for a huge DataScience project we would rather want a Relational one, which would be easier to scale.

F. **Foreign Key and Primary Key Definitions**
   - **Foreign Key**: A column that links the key to another table.
   - **Primary Key**: It is used to identify a table, similar to a key of a map.

G. **ACID Properties in Database Management**
   - **Properties**: Acid stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability it ensures that transactions between databases are consistent and secure.

H. **Merise and UML Definitions, Utilization in IT, Specific Use Cases with Schemas**
   - **Merise**: A methodology used for system managements
   - **UML**: Unified Modeling Language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting software systems. It is usually one of the first diagram you write in an System Requirement and Specification
   - **Utilization**:
  #### ADD EXAMPLE

I. **SQL Language Definition, Common Commands, and Types of Joins**
   - **Definition**: Structured Query Language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
   - **Commands**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
   - **Joins**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN.
